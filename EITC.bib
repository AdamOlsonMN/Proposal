	tended to be shunted aside when the opportunities for health reform
	are most promising, the final years of the Johnson administration

	to large new population groups and offer insights into the continuing

	and Congress over the tax cut's size and primary beneficiaries. Ideological
	divisions in Congress are such that building a majority coalition
	for liberally-oriented tax-cut and tax-reform legislation is difficult.
	Party and ideology were both salient in the Kemp-Roth vote in each
	chamber and also in the Gorman amendment vote in the House. In the
	Senate, the relationship between party and tax cut benefits was unimpressive,
	although a modest relationship emerged between ideology and the latter.},

  abstract = {As governmental activity has expanded, scholars have been increasingly
	inclined to suggest that the structure of public policies has an
	important influence on patterns of political change. Yet research
	on policy feedback is mostly anecdotal, and there has so far been
	little attempt to develop more general hypotheses about the conditions
	under which policies produce politics. Drawing on recent research,
	this article suggests that feedback occurs through two main mechanisms.
	Policies generate resources and incentives for political actors,
	and they provide those actors with information and cues that encourage
	particular interpretations of the political world. These mechanisms
	operate in a variety of ways, but have significant effects on government
	elites, interest groups, and mass publics. By investigating how policies
	influence different actors through these distinctive mechanisms,
	the article outlines a research agenda for moving from the current
	focus on illustrative case studies to the investigation of broader
	propositions about how and when policies are likely to be politically
	consequential.},
